## Feature Request: Event Scheduling and Calendar Integration

### Overview
Implement comprehensive event scheduling and calendar integration functionality to provide visual calendar views, recurring event management, and synchronization with external calendar systems for the Mergington High School Activities Management System.

### Current State
The current application provides basic scheduling with:
- Simple text-based schedule descriptions (e.g., "Fridays, 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM")
- No visual calendar interface
- No integration with external calendar systems

### Proposed Enhancement
Develop a robust scheduling and calendar system that includes:

#### 1. Visual Calendar Interface
- **Monthly View**: Full-month calendar display with activity events
- **Weekly View**: Detailed weekly schedule view with time slots
- **Daily View**: Daily agenda view with detailed event information
- **List View**: Alternative list-based view of upcoming events
- **Activity-Specific Calendars**: Individual calendar views for specific activities

#### 2. Advanced Event Management
- **Event Creation**: Rich event creation with detailed scheduling options
- **Event Types**: Support for different event types (regular sessions, special events, competitions, field trips)
- **Event Details**: Comprehensive event information (location, duration, requirements, materials needed)
- **Event Modifications**: Easy editing and updating of scheduled events
- **Event Cancellation**: Proper handling of cancelled events with notifications

#### 3. Recurring Event Support
- **Recurring Patterns**: Support for various recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)
- **Pattern Exceptions**: Handle exceptions to recurring patterns (holidays, school breaks)
- **Bulk Operations**: Modify multiple recurring events simultaneously
- **Series Management**: Manage recurring event series with proper versioning
- **Holiday Integration**: Automatic consideration of school holidays and breaks

#### 4. External Calendar Integration
- **Google Calendar Sync**: Two-way synchronization with Google Calendar
- **Outlook Integration**: Support for Microsoft Outlook calendar integration
- **Apple Calendar**: iCal format support for Apple Calendar and other compatible applications
- **ICS Export**: Generate ICS files for calendar imports
- **Subscription Feeds**: Provide calendar subscription URLs for automatic updates

#### 5. Resource Management
- **Room Booking**: Integration with school facility/room booking systems
- **Equipment Scheduling**: Track and schedule shared equipment and resources
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection and prevention of scheduling conflicts
- **Resource Availability**: Real-time display of resource availability
- **Multi-Resource Events**: Support for events requiring multiple resources

#### 6. Time Zone and Scheduling Intelligence
- **Time Zone Support**: Handle multiple time zones for remote participants
- **Optimal Scheduling**: Suggest optimal meeting times based on participant availability
- **Buffer Time**: Automatic buffer time between consecutive events
- **Travel Time**: Consider travel time between different locations
- **Capacity Planning**: Prevent overbooking of resources and facilities

### Technical Implementation
- **Calendar API Integration**: Integration with Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph API
- **Date/Time Libraries**: Robust handling of dates, times, and time zones
- **Recurring Logic**: Implement complex recurring event logic with proper exception handling
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or similar technology for real-time calendar updates
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly calendar interface for mobile devices

### User Stories
1. **As a student**, I want to see all my activities in a visual calendar so that I can better plan my schedule.
2. **As a teacher**, I want to schedule recurring activity sessions so that I don't have to create each session individually.
3. **As a parent**, I want to sync my child's activity schedule to my personal calendar so that I can plan family activities accordingly.
4. **As an administrator**, I want to prevent scheduling conflicts by checking resource availability before confirming events.
5. **As an activity coordinator**, I want to quickly reschedule events due to weather or facility issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Visual calendar interface with multiple view options (monthly, weekly, daily)
- [ ] Support for recurring events with various patterns and exceptions
- [ ] Two-way synchronization with at least Google Calendar
- [ ] ICS export functionality for calendar imports
- [ ] Resource booking integration with conflict detection
- [ ] Mobile-responsive calendar interface
- [ ] Time zone support for multi-location events
- [ ] Bulk event management operations
- [ ] Integration with existing activity and participant systems

### Priority
Medium-High - Important for user experience and practical usability in a school environment.

### Dependencies
- External calendar API accounts and credentials
- Resource management system (if implementing facility booking)
- Notification system (for schedule changes)
- User authentication system

### Estimated Complexity
**Large** - Complex feature requiring calendar API integrations, sophisticated date/time handling, and comprehensive UI development.

### Integration Considerations
- **Privacy**: Ensure appropriate privacy controls for calendar sharing
- **Performance**: Optimize calendar rendering for large numbers of events
- **Offline Support**: Consider offline calendar viewing capabilities
- **Accessibility**: Ensure calendar interface is accessible to users with disabilities
- **Data Migration**: Plan for migrating existing schedule data to new calendar format

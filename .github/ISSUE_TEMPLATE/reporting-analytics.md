## Feature Request: Reporting and Analytics Dashboard

### Overview
Implement comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to provide insights into participation rates, activity frequency, impact metrics, and overall program effectiveness for the Mergington High School Activities Management System.

### Current State
The current application provides basic activity management with:
- No reporting capabilities
- No data analytics or insights
- No data export functionality
- Limited visibility into participation patterns and trends

### Proposed Enhancement
Develop a robust analytics and reporting system that includes:

#### 1. Comprehensive Dashboard
- **Executive Dashboard**: High-level overview for administrators with key metrics
- **Activity Dashboard**: Detailed analytics for specific activities and programs
- **Participant Dashboard**: Individual student progress and participation insights
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Tools for teachers to monitor their activities and participants
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Live updates of participation and engagement metrics

#### 2. Participation Analytics
- **Enrollment Trends**: Track signup patterns and enrollment trends over time
- **Participation Rates**: Calculate and visualize participation rates by activity, grade, demographic
- **Retention Analysis**: Monitor participant retention and dropout patterns
- **Engagement Metrics**: Measure active participation and engagement levels
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Participation analysis by grade level, gender, and other demographics

#### 3. Activity Performance Metrics
- **Activity Popularity**: Ranking and trending analysis of activity popularity
- **Capacity Utilization**: Track how well activities utilize their maximum capacity
- **Schedule Optimization**: Analyze optimal scheduling patterns and time slots
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor usage of facilities, equipment, and other resources
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Calculate cost per participant and program efficiency metrics

#### 4. Impact and Outcome Tracking
- **Academic Impact**: Correlation between activity participation and academic performance
- **Skill Development**: Track skill improvement and competency development
- **Achievement Tracking**: Monitor awards, certifications, and accomplishments
- **Goal Completion**: Analyze goal-setting effectiveness and completion rates
- **Long-term Outcomes**: Track long-term benefits and impact on student development

#### 5. Advanced Reporting Tools
- **Custom Report Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating custom reports
- **Scheduled Reports**: Automated generation and distribution of regular reports
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare performance across different time periods
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast trends and identify potential issues
- **Benchmarking**: Compare performance against school, district, or national benchmarks

#### 6. Data Export and Integration
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Support for PDF, Excel, CSV, and other common formats
- **API Access**: RESTful APIs for integration with external analytics tools
- **Data Warehouse**: Integration with existing school information systems
- **Real-Time Data Feeds**: Live data feeds for external dashboards and tools
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of required compliance and regulatory reports

### Technical Implementation
- **Data Pipeline**: Robust ETL processes for data collection and aggregation
- **Analytics Database**: Optimized data warehouse for fast query performance
- **Visualization Library**: Interactive charts and graphs using modern web technologies
- **Report Engine**: Flexible report generation engine with template support
- **Caching System**: Intelligent caching for improved dashboard performance
- **Data Security**: Encryption and access controls for sensitive analytics data

### User Stories
1. **As an administrator**, I want to see overall participation trends so that I can make informed decisions about program offerings.
2. **As a teacher**, I want to track my activity's performance metrics so that I can improve engagement and outcomes.
3. **As a data analyst**, I want to export detailed participation data so that I can perform advanced analysis in external tools.
4. **As a principal**, I want automated reports on activity impact so that I can demonstrate program value to stakeholders.
5. **As a guidance counselor**, I want to see which students aren't participating in activities so that I can encourage their involvement.

### Acceptance Criteria

## Feature Request: Activity Tracking and Logging

### Overview
Implement a comprehensive activity tracking and logging system to provide detailed insights into activity progress, categorization, and status management for the Mergington High School Activities Management System.

### Current State
The current application provides basic activity management with:
- Simple activity signup/unregister functionality
- Basic participant lists
- Static activity information

### Proposed Enhancement
Develop a robust tracking and logging system that includes:

#### 1. Detailed Activity Logging
- **Activity History**: Track all activity-related events (signups, cancellations, schedule changes, etc.)
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain detailed logs of who performed what actions and when
- **System Events**: Log system-level events such as errors, performance metrics, and user interactions
- **Activity States**: Track different states of activities (planned, active, completed, cancelled)

#### 2. Activity Categorization
- **Category Management**: Create and manage activity categories (Sports, Academic, Arts, Community Service, etc.)
- **Tag System**: Implement flexible tagging system for activities
- **Difficulty Levels**: Assign difficulty or skill levels to activities
- **Age/Grade Restrictions**: Categorize activities by appropriate age groups or grade levels

#### 3. Progress Tracking
- **Activity Progress**: Track completion percentages and progress metrics for ongoing activities
- **Participant Progress**: Monitor individual student progress within activities
- **Skill Development**: Track skill improvements and learning outcomes
- **Attendance Integration**: Link progress tracking with attendance data

#### 4. Milestones and Deadlines
- **Milestone Management**: Create and track activity milestones and checkpoints
- **Deadline Tracking**: Set and monitor important dates (registration deadlines, event dates, project due dates)
- **Automatic Reminders**: Send notifications for upcoming milestones and deadlines
- **Progress Reports**: Generate milestone-based progress reports

#### 5. Completion Status Management
- **Status Types**: Support multiple completion statuses (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled, On Hold)
- **Completion Criteria**: Define specific criteria for activity completion
- **Certification**: Generate completion certificates or badges
- **Achievement Tracking**: Record and display student achievements and accomplishments

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Schema**: Design appropriate tables for logging, categories, milestones, and progress tracking
- **API Endpoints**: Create RESTful endpoints for managing tracking data
- **Background Tasks**: Implement automated logging and reminder systems
- **Data Analytics**: Provide data aggregation and analysis capabilities

### User Stories
1. **As an administrator**, I want to categorize activities by type and difficulty so that students can easily find suitable activities.
2. **As a teacher**, I want to track student progress in activities so that I can provide appropriate guidance and support.
3. **As a student**, I want to see my progress and upcoming milestones so that I can stay motivated and on track.
4. **As a system administrator**, I want detailed logs of all system activities so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Activities can be categorized into different types with flexible tag system
- [ ] All user actions and system events are properly logged with timestamps
- [ ] Progress tracking shows percentage completion and milestone achievements
- [ ] Deadline and milestone management with automated reminder system
- [ ] Completion status can be set and tracked for all activities
- [ ] Historical data is preserved and queryable for reporting purposes
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal on existing functionality

### Priority
High - This foundational feature will enable better activity management and provide the data foundation for analytics and reporting features.

### Dependencies
- Database schema updates
- User authentication system (for audit trails)
- Notification system (for reminders)

### Estimated Complexity
**Large** - This is a comprehensive feature that touches multiple parts of the system and requires significant backend development.

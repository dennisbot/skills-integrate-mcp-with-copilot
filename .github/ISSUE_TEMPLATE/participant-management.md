## Feature Request: Enhanced Participant Management System

### Overview
Implement a comprehensive participant management system that provides role-based access control, attendance tracking, and automated notifications for the Mergington High School Activities Management System.

### Current State
The current application provides basic participant management with:
- Simple email-based participant lists
- Basic signup/unregister functionality
- No role differentiation or access control

### Proposed Enhancement
Develop a robust participant management system that includes:

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- **User Roles**: Implement multiple user roles (Student, Teacher, Administrator, Activity Coordinator, Parent/Guardian)
- **Permission System**: Define granular permissions for different actions (view, create, edit, delete activities)
- **Role Assignment**: Allow administrators to assign and modify user roles
- **Access Restrictions**: Enforce role-based restrictions on API endpoints and UI elements

#### 2. Enhanced Participant Profiles
- **Student Profiles**: Comprehensive student information (name, grade, contact info, interests, emergency contacts)
- **Teacher Profiles**: Staff information and activity supervision assignments
- **Parent Profiles**: Guardian information with student associations
- **Profile Management**: Allow users to update their own profiles within role constraints

#### 3. Attendance Tracking System
- **Check-in/Check-out**: Digital attendance tracking for activity sessions
- **Attendance History**: Maintain detailed attendance records for each participant
- **Attendance Reports**: Generate attendance reports for teachers and administrators
- **Absence Management**: Track and manage planned and unplanned absences
- **Make-up Sessions**: Support for scheduling and tracking make-up sessions

#### 4. Advanced Registration Management
- **Registration Status**: Track different registration states (pending, confirmed, waitlisted, cancelled)
- **Waitlist Management**: Automatic promotion from waitlist when spots become available
- **Prerequisites**: Enforce prerequisite requirements for certain activities
- **Medical Clearances**: Track required medical clearances and permissions
- **Payment Status**: Integration with payment tracking for fee-based activities

#### 5. Notification System
- **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for important events
- **SMS Reminders**: Optional SMS reminders for activities and deadlines
- **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable notification preferences
- **Emergency Alerts**: Broadcast emergency notifications to all relevant participants

#### 6. Communication Tools
- **Participant Messaging**: Internal messaging system between participants and coordinators
- **Announcement System**: Activity-specific announcements and updates
- **Group Communications**: Bulk messaging to activity groups
- **Parent Communications**: Direct communication channels with parents/guardians

### Technical Implementation
- **Authentication System**: Implement robust user authentication with role management
- **Database Design**: Design comprehensive user and participant data models
- **API Security**: Implement role-based API access controls
- **Notification Service**: Integration with email and SMS services
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for mobile check-in/check-out

### User Stories
1. **As an administrator**, I want to assign different roles to users so that I can control who can access what functionality.
2. **As a teacher**, I want to track attendance for my activities so that I can monitor participation and identify at-risk students.
3. **As a student**, I want to check in and out of activities using my phone so that my attendance is automatically recorded.
4. **As a parent**, I want to receive notifications about my child's activities so that I can stay informed about their participation.
5. **As an activity coordinator**, I want to send reminders to participants so that attendance rates improve.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Role-based access control system with at least 4 different user roles
- [ ] Digital check-in/check-out system with mobile support
- [ ] Attendance tracking with historical records and reporting
- [ ] Email and SMS notification system with user preferences
- [ ] Waitlist management with automatic promotion
- [ ] Emergency contact management and emergency notification capabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive user profiles with appropriate privacy controls
- [ ] Integration with existing activity management system

### Priority
High - Essential for scaling the system to handle a real school environment with proper access controls and attendance tracking.

### Dependencies
- User authentication system
- Email/SMS service integration
- Database schema updates
- Mobile-responsive UI components

### Estimated Complexity
**Large** - This feature requires significant development across authentication, database design, notification systems, and user interface components.

### Security Considerations
- Personal data protection and COPPA compliance for student data
- Role-based access controls to protect sensitive information
- Secure handling of contact information and emergency contacts
- Audit logging for access to student records
